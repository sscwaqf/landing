Lack of knowledge about opportunities available to students is one of the biggest factors preventing students from backward regions of Haryana State succeeding in various career options. The establishment of the SSC Coaching centre in Punhana, Mewat is the first step in the direction of providing an environment of hope and success. It is the endeavor of Haryana Waqf Board that the best facilities may be made available to the students desirous of preparing for competitive examinations. Class rooms equipped with all requirements, a well-stocked library, expert faculty and regular extension lectures have been made available to the students taking admission.

Bringing a positive change in society is one of the objectives of the Haryana Waqf Board.  For this purpose, the Board has resolved to increase its spending in the education sector.  Education is the best thing that can happen to help the young population create opportunities for themselves and learn how can they be the wheels of change that everyone dreams of. This is the responsibility that the Haryana Waqf Board has taken upon itself and has successfully established this first coaching centre. Plans are afoot to open more such centres in various parts of Haryana.

It is true that experience is one of life’s best teachers. But if you don’t study you will probably never get any experience in the first place. I would like to exhort students to work hard and leave no stone unturned in their drive towards success in their chosen goal. The coaching and counselling centre can provide guidance and help but the actual effort must be of the student.  You have the potential to succeed. Let no one tell you that you are not capable. Therefore, get up, start working and do not stop until you achieve your goal. Your family, society, and country are looking up to you.

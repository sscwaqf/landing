      I feel a lot is to be done in the field of education especially in Mewat, Nuh district of Haryana. Recently government of India declared this district as the most backward district of India. I being the Chairman of HWB, promise that Haryana Waqf Board will do everything whatever is possible to uplift this area especially in the field of education. This Coaching Centre will help our youth to get the employment they deserve. My best wishes to everyone associated with this Centre.
